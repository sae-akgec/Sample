            <p>This competition is an eco friendly venture based upon
              Engineering design and manufacturing of Electric bike
              completely by the students. The main aim of the event
              is to generate the interest of the student in the field
              of eco-bikes,and to bring a new revolution in the field
              of biking which can be commercialized as a usable product
              for the future generation. Beside the comprehensive knowledge
              of manufacturing and fabricating a single seated DC motor driven
              vehicle to maneuver on all types of terrains the E-bike Racing
              Challenge has a chance for participants to win many awards .
